This is the Cute Health App from the Cutecore Co.
This is where you can track your mental, physical, and emotional health needs! Users can create goals to track their personal
health goals, reminders to help them keep track of pills and other things to do, and diaries to give users a space to express
their emotions and any other miscellaneous thoughts. Users also conveniently have access to a calendar to help keep track of
their time and emotions.

Here is the calendar documentation we will use: https://fullcalendar.io/docs

Here are the icons we will use from Material UI: https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/
